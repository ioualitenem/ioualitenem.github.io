		<h2> Biography </h2>
		<p> 
			I'm currently a Financial Engineering graduate student at HEC Montreal. 
			I like reading about new mathematical models for finance and replicating new scientific papers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This website exists for me to share my interests and the projects I am working on.
			Feel free to take a look and contact me if you have any questions about something I did.

		<h2> Personal Projects </h2>
		<h3> MSGARCH & GAS on HF Data </h3>
		<h4> <i> Work in progress </i> </h4>
		<p>
			A research note on the application of Markov Switching GARCH models 
		</p>
		<p>
			(<a class="h-links" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MSGARCH/index.html"> <strong> MSGARCH </strong> </a>) 
			and Generalized Autoregressive Score models 
			(<a class="h-links" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GAS/index.html"> <strong> GAS </strong> </a>)
			on high-frequency data of a panel of different assets. 
		<p>
			This project will act as my supervised project for my masters degree and posted when finished.

		<h3> Black-Scholes-Merton Model Summary </h3>
		<h4> <i> Work in progress </i> </h4>
		<p>
			A paper summarizing & simplifying the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation formula.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is a paper aimed at helping people use and/or code the formula while getting the gist of its assumptions,
			derivations, limitations and extensions. 
			It also doubles as a way for me to review litterature about one of the most
			used models of our times and dig deeper into its strength and weaknesses in order to read on better models. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It will be posted on this website when finished.

		<h3> WildCard Option Valuation </h3>
		<h4> <i> Currently being cleaned </i> </h4>
		<p>
			This project was made in collaboration with my good friends : Dimitri Arcé & Édouardo Magini. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A small project on the valuation of a WildCard Option on the 
			<a class="h-links" href="https://www.m-x.ca/en/markets/interest-rate-derivatives/lgb"> LGB </a> 
			contract launched by <a class="h-links" href="https://www.tmx.com/"> TMX </a> in Fall 2021. 
			The idea was to replicate the spot rate term structure by using the CIR++ model proposed by Brigo & Mercurio
			<a class="h-links" href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-34604-3"> (2006) </a> 
			using an exact simulation (Glasserman 
			<a class="h-links" href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21617-1"> 2003) </a>
			and pricing the option using the formulas from Kane & Marcus 
			<a class="h-links" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=278028"> (1986) </a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A report is currently being translated and will be posted alongside a Python script.

			Please note that some libraries/packages that can "translate" code from one language to another exist; 
			such as <a class="h-links" href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/"> <strong> reticulate </strong> </a> which does Python to R; 
			however, they may not work the way it was intended to work and should not be relied upon blindly.

		<h2> Benchmark of the website</h2>
		<p>
			I coded this website myself using only HTML & CSS. The idea was to make this website as light as possible
			without any cookies, font packages or JavaScript. It can be opened on any device and any internet speed.
		</p>
		<p>
			This quest to be as optimal and concise as possible was inspired by my good tech-savy friend : 
			<a class="h-links" href="https://archetipico.github.io/"> Edoardo Ferrari. </a>
		</p>
		<p>
			TBD
